  Slide  41: Then there was the speckled one. And the one with the chip in it. And ...

  Slide  85: One shell became available, and the whole community moved up together....

--- mabel-and-harold-new.webp ---
  Slide  87: "I had no idea we did that," Harold said.

--- mabel.webp ---
  Slide  88: "Most crabs don't. They think growth is a solo project."

  Slide 101: "You know," Harold said slowly, "I tried to bring all my stuff with me...
  Slide 102: "What happened?" "A seagull."

--- mabel.webp ---
  Slide 103: Mabel laughed.

--- mabel-and-harold-new.webp ---
  Slide 104: "I only brought what I could carry in one trip," Harold said. "My sea ...

  Slide 118: You cannot skip it. You cannot stuff your new shell with your old life...
  Slide 119: But here's the part they don't tell you: You've done this before.
  Slide 120: Every shell you've ever had, you once thought you couldn't leave. And ...
  Slide 121: Some crabs never leave. They call it their comfort zone. But there's n...
  Slide 122: Harold sat with that thought for a while. The moon rose over the ocean...
  Slide 123: Harold leaned into the curve of his shell - a new curve, one he was st...
