Once upon a time, on a beach that smelled of salt and adventure, there lived a hermit crab named Harold.

---

Harold loved his shell. It was small and brown and fit him perfectly. He could tuck himself inside and peek out at the world, safe and snug.

---

![images/harold-happy.jpg]
"This," Harold would say to anyone who'd listen, "is the best shell on the whole beach."

---

![images/harold-squished.jpg]
But Harold kept eating seaweed. And prawns. And whatever else hermit crabs eat when no one's looking. And one morning, Harold woke up feeling... squished.

---

![images/harold-squished.jpg]
He tried to stretch. He couldn't. He tried to turn around. He couldn't do that either.

---

His friend Mabel - an older hermit crab with a sensible grey shell - scuttled over. "Harold," she said, "you've gotten bigger."

---

![images/harold-and-mabel.jpg]
"Leave my shell? This shell and I have been through everything together!" Harold shook his head. "And besides - a bigger shell would be heavier."

---

![images/harold-and-mabel.jpg]
"And yet," said Mabel, "you can't breathe."

---

That evening, a young hermit crab named Edwin found Harold sulking behind a rock. "Why do you look so sad?" Edwin asked.

---

![images/harold-and-edwin.jpg]
"It's when your shell used to fit perfectly, and now it doesn't, and you have to leave even though you don't want to."

---

![images/harold-and-edwin.jpg]
"Does it happen to everyone?" Harold thought about this. "I suppose it does. If you're lucky enough to keep growing."

---

![images/harold-moonlight.jpg]
That night, Harold couldn't sleep. He watched the moon rise over the ocean and thought about all the shells he'd had before.

---

![images/harold-moonlight.jpg]
He'd left them all. And every single time, he'd felt squished first. And every single time, he'd been terrified. And every single time, he'd been fine.

---

![images/harold-searching.jpg]
The next morning, Harold made a decision. He scuttled along the shoreline, looking. Searching.

---

![images/harold-searching.jpg]
He passed a massive shell - gorgeous, speckled, nearly twice his size. But it was too big. Too heavy to carry. Maybe in a couple of crab-years. Not now.

---

![images/harold-searching.jpg]
Then he saw another one. He circled it. Inspected it. Peered inside. It had a rather fetching spiral pattern. Streamlined. Aerodynamic.

---

![images/harold-between-shells.jpg]
Harold positioned his old shell right next to the new one. Close as he could get. One quick move. That's all it would take. But that move meant being naked. Soft. Exposed.

---

![images/harold-between-shells.jpg]
Harold grabbed his sea glass and one clawful of sand - just the good stuff - and wiggled out of his old shell. Naked. Soft. Ridiculous.

---

![images/harold-between-shells.jpg]
A seagull squawked overhead. Harold didn't think. He threw himself inside.

---

![images/harold-new-shell.jpg]
The walls were in different places. The curves were unfamiliar. He didn't know which way to lean when the waves came. But he could breathe. He could stretch.

---

![images/harold-new-shell.jpg]
There was space - so much space - for things he hadn't even thought of yet. "Okay," Harold admitted. "Maybe this is actually... better."

---

![images/crab-chain.jpg]
A queue of hermit crabs. Lined up from biggest to smallest. All waiting beside a row of empty shells. One shell became available, and the whole community moved up together.

---

![images/crab-chain.jpg]
"When you move to a bigger shell, you leave your old one behind. And someone smaller moves into it. And someone smaller moves into theirs."

---

![images/crab-chain.jpg]
"So when I grow..." "You make room for everyone behind you."

---

![images/harold-watches-edwin.jpg]
And there - at the very end - was a tiny crab with a familiar face. Edwin. Climbing into a shell Harold recognised. One of his old shells.

---

![images/harold-watches-edwin.jpg]
Edwin poked his head out and looked around, delighted. Then Edwin started rearranging things. Pushing sand around. Making it his own. Harold smiled.

---

![images/harold-stargazing.jpg]
Harold leaned into the curve of his shell - a new curve, one he was still learning - and watched the stars.

---

![images/harold-stargazing.jpg]
He wasn't squished anymore. But he knew he would be again. And that would mean he was still growing.
