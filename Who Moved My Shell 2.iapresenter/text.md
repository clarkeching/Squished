## 1. The Bay


---


	A long, long time ago, in a shallow, sunlit bay, there lived a group of hermit crabs. 

---

	Each crab carried a shell on their back.

	A sturdy, comfortable home they had found and claimed during their journey through life. 

---


	For a time, these shells fit perfectly, offering protection and a sense of security. 

---


	But as the crabs grew, their once-cozy homes began to feel *cramped and tight*.


---
## 2. Curly

---

	One day, a wise old hermit crab named Curly noticed that his shell was getting too snug. 

---


	It was harder to move around, and he realized that he would need to find a bigger shell soon. 
---

	Curly had been around for a while, so this was no surprise to him. 

	He knew the importance of making the right choice.

---


	As he ventured along the shore, Curly found several new shells—some were too big, some too small, and others already occupied.
	But none were *Just Right*.

	He would keep looking.

---


	Curly thought about the effort it would take to leave his current shell and how exposed he would be during the transition. 

---


	But he also knew that staying in his old shell would eventually hinder his growth.

## 3. Pebble

---

	Meanwhile, in another part of the bay, a young hermit crab named Pebble was having the same problem. 

---

	Pebble’s shell had served her well for a while, but now it was just too tight. 
---


	She could barely squeeze into it, and she knew it was coming time to move on. 

---


	But unlike Curly, Pebble felt anxious about leaving the safety of her current home.

## 4. The Gathering

---


	One evening, Curly and Pebble met at a gathering of hermit crabs, all of whom were experiencing the same dilemma. 

---

	The older crabs, like Curly, shared their wisdom with the younger ones. 

---

	> “Change is a natural part of life.”


---

	> “The discomfort you feel now is simply a sign you are ready for something new.”

---
	The younger crabs listened, but the older crabs words didn’t really help.
---

	Then Curly shared a secret he had learned over the years …

## 5. The Secret

	> In times like these, it’s best not to go it alone. 

---


	> Let’s work together … to find the right fit.

---

	> Let me show you how.

## Moving Day

---

	The next day, Curly, Pebble, and bunch of other crabs met up on the shore.


---

	They were all living in shells that were just a bit too small for them. 

---
	Curly pointed to a large, empty shell that was sitting on the beach.

	> I found that shell early this morning. It’s my new home.

---
	Curly asked the other crabs to form a line, from the smallest to the largest. 

	And they did
---

	Curly then wiggled out of his shell - while the other crabs averted their eyes (since he was naked) - then wriggled into his new larger shell.
---
	Then the 2nd largest shell exited her shell (while everyone looked away), and moved into Curly’s old home.

---

	And then - one by one - the crabs swapped shells. 

---


	After the swap, each crab marvelled at how much more comfortable they felt in their new homes. 

	They had room to grow.

---

	Curly looked around at the group and smiled. 

	> This is how we grow. By embracing change and helping each other grow.

## The Fear 
## v.s. 
## The Reward

---

	Pebble, now snug in her new shell, realized the fear she had felt before was natural, but that the reward of growth was worth it. 

---

	She understood that sometimes you have to *let go of what no longer fits* to *make room for something better*.
---

	She realised that by working together the crabs  minimised the time they were naked and vulnerable, without their shells.
---

	From that day forward, the hermit crabs of the bay continued to grow and thrive. 
---


	They learned that change, though scary, was a necessary part of life. 

---


	And whenever it was time to move on to a new shell, they knew they could count on each other for support.
---
	The hardest part?
	
---

	 Recognising when their shells were getting squishy and tight.

---

## How squishy is your shell?
