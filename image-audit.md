# Image Audit

Instructions: Go through the website in picture mode and mark each scene.
- **Status**: ✅ KEEP / ⚠️ OK FOR NOW / 🔁 REDO / ❌ CUT IMAGE
- **Notes**: anything — wrong vibe, inconsistent character, bad composition, etc.

The early section (Scenes 1–5) already works well with multiple images.
From Scene 6 onward, we shift to one-image-per-scene.

Page numbers match the on-screen page numbers in picture mode.

## EARLY SECTION — multiple images, already working

### Scene 1: Harold is Happy (pages 3–6)
**Image:** `harold-happy.png` (used 4 times)
**Text:** "Once upon a time..." through "And for a while, it was."
**Status:** ✅
**Notes:**

### Scene 2: Harold Feels Squished (pages 7–11)
**Image:** `harold-squished.png` (used 5 times)
**Text:** "But Harold kept eating seaweed..." through "(It hadn't.)"
**Status:** ✅
**Notes:**

### Scene 3: Mabel Intervenes (pages 12–18)
**Images:**
- `mabel-and-harold.png` — "you've gotten bigger"
- `harold-happy.png` — "I'm exactly the same size" (denial)
- `mabel-the-look.png` — The Look, "you need a bigger shell", "you can't breathe"
- `harold-squished.png` — "Leave my shell?", "Harold had no answer"

**Status:** ✅
**Notes:**

### Scene 4: Edwin (pages 19–29)
**Images:**
- `edwin.png` — Edwin asking questions (4 slides)
- `harold-squished.png` — Harold's answers (4 slides)
- `edwin-wow.png` — "I hope I get squished one day"
- `harold-happy.png` — Harold laughs, "Trust me, you will"

**Status:** ✅
**Notes:**

**Image:** `harold-squished.png` (used 6 times)
**Text:** "Here's the thing about hermit crabs..." through "he was avoiding it"
**Status:** ✅
**Notes:**

---

## MID/LATE SECTION — one image per scene

### Scene 6: Night Contemplation (pages 36–42)
**Image:** `harold-contemplating.png` (used 7 times)
**Text:** "That night, Harold couldn't sleep..." through "Huh, said Harold."
**Status:** ✅
**Notes:**

### Scene 7: The Search (pages 43–49)
**Text:** "The next morning, Harold made a decision..." through "It looked good. It looked right."
**Current images:**
- `harold-scuttling.png` — decides to search (1 slide)
- `dream-shell.png` — the too-big dream shell (2 slides)
- `harold-meh-shell.png` — the beat-up shell (1 slide)
- `new-shell-empty.png` — finds the right shell, circles it, inspects it (3 slides)

**Idea:** The three shells (dream, meh, perfect) could all be **shell-only still lifes** — no Harold in the scene. Easier to generate, more consistent. Harold scuttling could stay or be cut.

**Status for `harold-scuttling.png`:** ✅ — replaced with new wider shot, looks great.
**Status for `dream-shell.png`:** ✅
**Status for `harold-meh-shell.png`:** 🔄 - Harold's shell that he is wearing is totally wrong!  Replace it with just a picture of the new meh shell
**Status for `new-shell-empty.png`:** 🔄 this one looks wonderful, except that the shell he is wearing is all wrong.
**Notes:**

### Scene 8: The Decision / The Hesitation (pages 50–57)
**Text:** "Harold positioned his old shell right next to the new one..." through "Did he really want to weigh it down with all his old stuff too?"
**Current images:**
- `new-shell-empty.png` — positions old shell next to new (2 slides) 🔄 Right now, he's in the wrong coloured shell.
- `harold-moving-scared.jpeg` — "naked, soft, exposed" (1 slide) 🔄 I tried to overcome the AI generation problems, by pixelating the image so it was mildly amusing, but it sucks.
- `harold-nervous.png` — "Here we go" (1 slide) 🔄 that's okay, but I'd be happy to replace it with 1 image.
- `harold-squished-facing-right.png` — stops, still in old shell (1 slide) 🔄
- `harold-squished.png` — all his stuff, can't leave it (5 slides) 🔄

**This is the messiest scene image-wise** — 5 different images for one emotional beat (hesitation/fear). Could this be one image?

**Status for `new-shell-empty.png` (reuse):** 🔄
**Status for `harold-moving-scared.jpeg`:** 🔄
**Status for `harold-nervous.png`:** 🔄
**Status for `harold-squished-facing-right.png`:** 🔄
**Status for `harold-squished.png` (reuse):** 🔄
**Notes:**


### Scene 9: The Naked Dash (pages 58–62)
**Current images:**
- `harold-moving.png` — the move itself (4 slides)
- `seagull.png` — the seagull squawks (1 slide)

**Status for `harold-moving.png`:** 🔄
**Status for `seagull.png`:** ✅
**Notes:**

### Scene 10: The New Shell (pages 63–71)
**Image:** `harold-new-shell.png` (used 9 times)
**Text:** "He looked around. Strange." through "he scuttled past sea grass"
**Status:**
**Notes:**

### Scene 11: The Queue (pages 72–75)
**Image:** `the-queue.png` (used 4 times)
**Text:** "A queue of hermit crabs..." through "the whole community moved up"
**Status:**
**Notes:**

### Scene 12: Mabel & Harold Reunite / Edwin in Old Shell (pages 76–85)
**Current images:**
- `mabel-and-harold.png` — conversation (5 slides)
- `mabel.png` — Mabel's wisdom (4 slides)
- `edwin.png` — Edwin in old shell (5 slides)
- `harold-new-shell.png` — Harold smiles (1 slide)

**This is long.** Could be split or simplified. Key question: do all three character images (mabel, mabel-and-harold, edwin) work well enough?

**Status for `mabel-and-harold.png`:**
**Status for `mabel.png`:**
**Status for `edwin.png` (reuse from earlier):**
**Notes:**

### Scene 13: The Closing Reflection (pages 86–90)
**Current images:**
- `harold-contemplating.png` — reflections on growth (5 slides)
- `harold-moving.png` — "that naked moment" (1 slide)
- `harold-squished.png` — "comfort zone" (1 slide)
- `harold-new-shell.png` — final 2 slides, leaning into new shell

**Could this be mostly `harold-contemplating.png` with `harold-new-shell.png` for the final beat?**

**Status for `harold-contemplating.png` (reuse):**
**Status for `harold-new-shell.png` (reuse):**
**Status for `harold-moving.png` (reuse):**
**Status for `harold-squished.png` (reuse):**
**Notes:**

## SUMMARY AFTER AUDIT

**Total distinct images currently:** 19 used + 2 unused = 21
**Images I'm happy with:**
**Images that need redoing:**
**Images that could be replaced with shell-only still lifes:**
**Scenes where I'd rather cut the image entirely:**

## NEXT STEPS (for Clarke & Claude to discuss)

After you fill this in, we can:
1. Identify which scenes shift to one-image-per-scene
2. Generate shell-only still lifes for the search scene
3. Consolidate messy multi-image scenes (especially Scene 8)
4. Update `picture-content.md` to match
