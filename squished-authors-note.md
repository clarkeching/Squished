# A Note From Clarke
### The Grown-Up Bit

---

## &nbsp;

	This story started in my work with leaders and their teams.

	The shell is a metaphor for the bottleneck - often the leader themselves, squished and holding everyone back without realising it.

---

## &nbsp;

	I used it to explain bottleneck thinking to teams without sounding like a process wonk. It's a kids' story, after all.

	Some people got it immediately. Others would say "No... oh, wait..." and then go quiet.

	The metaphor does a huge amount of heavy lifting, precisely because it's so light.

---

## &nbsp;

	Over time, I noticed something unexpected and delightful.

	People started sharing it beyond work. With their children. With friends. With partners who'd gotten squished.

	Many told me the timing was perfect - they were squished but hadn't named it yet.

---

## &nbsp;

	Back in the office: squished people lead to squished teams. Squished teams lead to squished organisations.

	It's shells within shells. Bottlenecks within bottlenecks.

---

## &nbsp;

	And it works the other way too - when one person moves to a bigger shell, they make room for everyone behind them.

	The whole system grows.

---

## &nbsp;

	And sometimes the answer isn't a bigger shell.

	It's clearing out the one you're in.

	Or finding a same-sized shell with a better view.

---

## &nbsp;

	There's comfort in realising that feeling squished is just part of growing.

	And moving to the next shell? It's always easier than you imagined - once you've done it.

---

## &nbsp;

	Now... go find your bigger shell.
