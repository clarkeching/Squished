SQUISHED - A Kids Book for Grown Ups - by Clarke Ching
"From a leader's viewpoint, creating the room for your people to grow into - that's priceless" — Ali Law, IT Leader, Financial Services, United Kingdom
(Almost) THE END
A Note From Clarke - The Grown-Up Bit
This story started in my work with leaders and their teams. The shell is a metaphor for the bottleneck - often the leader themselves, squished and holding everyone back without realising it.
I used it to explain bottleneck thinking to teams without sounding like a process wonk. It's a kids' story, after all. Some people got it immediately. Others would say "No... oh, wait..." and then go quiet. The metaphor does a huge amount of heavy lifting, precisely because it's so light.
Over time, I noticed something unexpected and delightful. People started sharing it beyond work. With their children. With friends. With partners who'd gotten squished. Many told me the timing was perfect - they were squished but hadn't named it yet.
Back in the office: squished people lead to squished teams. Squished teams lead to squished organisations. It's shells within shells. Bottlenecks within bottlenecks. And it works the other way too - when one person moves to a bigger shell, they make room for everyone behind them. The whole system grows.
And sometimes the answer isn't a bigger shell. It's clearing out the one you're in. Or finding a same-sized shell with a better view.
There's comfort in realising that feeling squished is just part of growing. And moving to the next shell? It's always easier than you imagined - once you've done it.
Now... go find your bigger shell.
