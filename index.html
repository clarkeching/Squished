                    <p>Harold loved his shell. It was small and brown and fit him perfectly. He could tuck himself inside and peek out at the world, safe and snug.</p>
                    <p>"This," Harold would say to anyone who'd listen, "is the best shell on the whole beach."</p>

                    <p>"Why do you look so sad?" Edwin asked.</p>

                    <p class="drop-cap">Here's the thing about hermit crabs that Harold had somehow forgotten, even though he was one:</p>
                    <p>Hermit crabs don't grow their own shells. They borrow them. They find empty shells left behind by other creatures, climb in, and call them home.</p>
                    <p>And when they outgrow one shell, they have to find another.</p>
                    <p>This is not optional. This is not a lifestyle choice. This is biology.</p>
                    <p>But knowing something and doing something are two very different things.</p>
                    <p>Actually, Harold hadn't really forgotten. He was avoiding it. Because leaving one shell and moving to the next is scary.</p>

                    <p>His first shell had been tiny. A little white spiral, barely bigger than a pebble - just like Edwin's. He'd loved that shell. But one day it got tight, and he'd left it behind.</p>
                    <p>Then there was the speckled one. And the one with the chip in it. And the one that was slightly lopsided but had good ventilation.</p>

                    <p>He scuttled along the shoreline, looking. Searching.</p>
                    <p>He passed a massive shell - gorgeous, speckled, nearly twice his size. For a moment, he imagined himself in it.</p>
                    <p>His dream shell.</p>
                    <p>But it was too big. Too heavy to carry. Too much space to fill. Maybe in a couple of crab-years. Not now.</p>
                    <p>And then he saw another one.</p>
                    <p>He circled it. Inspected it. Peered inside.</p>
                    <p>It had a rather fetching spiral pattern. And it was just sitting there, empty, waiting.</p>

                    <p>His old shell had things in it. His little pile of sand, arranged just so. His worn-smooth corner where he liked to sleep. His piece of gold sea glass - tumbled smooth by the ocean and perfect for leaning against. Crab-years of careful arrangement.</p>
                    <p>He couldn't just leave it all.</p>
                    <p>Could he?</p>
                    <p>Harold looked across at the new shell. Then back at his old stuff. He imagined carrying it all across - every grain, every pebble, every familiar scrap. Piling it into the new shell.</p>
                    <p>But the new shell was a different shape. The corners were in different places. His old pile of sand wouldn't fit the same way. His worn-smooth corner wouldn't exist.</p>

                    <p>He dashed across to the new one. But at the entrance, he stopped. Looked back at what was left in his old shell. Did he really need it? Did he really want it?</p>
                    <p>A seagull squawked overhead.</p>

                    <p>He went to investigate.</p>
                    <p>He'd been doing more of that lately. Coming out of his shell. Exploring. Looking for new things to put in new corners.</p>
                    <p>He scuttled past a patch of sea grass, swaying in the current. Harold had heard rumours there was another type of grass, up on the land somewhere. He didn't believe it.</p>
                    <p>And that's when he came across something remarkable.</p>
                    <p>A queue of hermit crabs. Lined up from biggest to smallest. All waiting beside a row of empty shells.</p>

                    <p class="drop-cap">Harold scanned the line of crabs. And there - at the very end - was a tiny crab with a familiar face.</p>
                    <p>Edwin.</p>
                    <p>The little crab was climbing into a shell Harold recognised. Small. Speckled. A little worn around the edges.</p>
                    <p>One of his old shells. From crab-years ago. He'd thought he could never leave that one, either.</p>
                    <p>Edwin poked his head out and looked around, delighted.</p>
                    <p>Harold watched him explore the corners. Watched him find a spot he seemed to like.</p>
                    <p>Then Edwin started rearranging things.</p>

                    <p>"What happened?"</p>

                    <p>"Left it behind."</p>

                    <p>Harold looked down at himself. He'd barely noticed, but he had been redecorating. His sea glass in a new spot. New pile of sand in a different corner. New favourite spot to watch the sunset.</p>

                    <p>This story started in my work with leaders and their teams. The shell is a metaphor for the bottleneck - often the leader themselves, squished and holding everyone back without realizing it.</p>
                    <p>But something unexpected happened. People started sharing it beyond work. With their children. With friends. With partners who'd gotten squished.</p>
                    <p>Many told me the timing was perfect - they were squished but hadn't named it yet. There's comfort in realizing that feeling squished is just part of growing.</p>
                    <p>And moving to the next shell? It's always easier than you imagined - once you've done it.</p>
