![Harold the hermit crab](/assets/harold-happy.png)

	Once upon a time, on a beach that smelled of salt and adventure, there lived a hermit crab named Harold.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold happy in his shell](/assets/harold-happy.png)

	Harold loved his shell. It was small and brown and fit him perfectly. He could tuck himself inside and peek out at the world, safe and snug.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold proud of his shell](/assets/harold-happy.png)

	"This," Harold would say to anyone who'd listen, "is the best shell on the whole beach."

---

## &nbsp;

![And for a while it was](/assets/harold-happy.png)

	And for a while, it was.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold feeling squished](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	But Harold kept eating seaweed. And prawns. And whatever else hermit crabs eat when no one's looking.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold woke up squished](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	And one morning, Harold woke up feeling... *squished.*

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold trying to stretch](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	He tried to stretch. He couldn't. He tried to turn around. He couldn't do that either.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold in denial](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	"Hmm," said Harold. "The shell must have shrunk in the wash."

---

## &nbsp;

![It hadn't](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	(It hadn't.)

---

## &nbsp;

![Mabel scuttles over](/assets/mabel-and-harold.png)

	His friend Mabel - an older hermit crab with a sensible grey shell - scuttled over.

---

## &nbsp;

![Mabel tells Harold](/assets/mabel-and-harold.png)

	"Harold," she said, "you've gotten bigger."

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold protests](/assets/harold-happy.png)

	"Impossible. I'm exactly the same size I've always been. I'm just... *compressed.*"

---

## &nbsp;

![Mabel gives Harold The Look](/assets/mabel-the-look.png)

	Mabel gave him The Look. You know the one.

---

## &nbsp;

![You need a bigger shell](/assets/mabel-the-look.png)

	"You need a bigger shell," she said.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold refuses](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	"Leave my shell? This shell and I have been through everything together!"

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold shakes his head](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	Harold shook his head. "And besides - a bigger shell would be heavier. I'd have to learn how to carry it all over again."

---

## &nbsp;

![And yet](/assets/mabel-the-look.png)

	"And yet," said Mabel, "you can't breathe."

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold has no answer](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	Harold had no answer for this.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin finds Harold](/assets/edwin.png)

	That evening, a young hermit crab named Edwin found Harold sulking behind a rock.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin asks](/assets/edwin.png)

	"Why do you look so sad?" Edwin asked.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold explains](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	"I'm not sad. I'm *squished.*"

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin curious](/assets/edwin.png)

	"What's squished?"

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold sighs](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	Harold sighed.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold defines squished](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	"It's when your shell used to fit perfectly, and now it doesn't, and you have to leave even though you don't want to."

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin's eyes go wide](/assets/edwin.png)

	Edwin's eyes went wide. "That sounds terrible."

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold warns](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	"It is. But if you wait too long... you can't leave at all."

---

## &nbsp;

![Does it happen to everyone](/assets/edwin.png)

	"Does it happen to everyone?"

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold thinks](/assets/harold-squished.png)

	Harold thought about this. "I suppose it does. If you're lucky enough to keep growing."

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin looks at his shell](/assets/edwin-wow.png)

	Edwin looked at his own tiny shell - a little white spiral, barely bigger than a pebble.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin hopes](/assets/edwin-wow.png)

	"I hope I get squished one day."

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold laughs](/assets/harold-happy.png)

	Harold laughed. It was the first time he'd laughed all week.

---

## &nbsp;

![Trust me](/assets/harold-happy.png)

	"Trust me," he said. "You will."

---

## &nbsp;

![How hermit crabs grow](/assets/how-crabs-grow.png)

	Here's the thing about hermit crabs that Harold had somehow forgotten, even though he was one:

---

## &nbsp;

![Hermit crabs borrow shells](/assets/how-crabs-grow.png)

	Hermit crabs don't grow their own shells. They borrow them. They find empty shells left behind by other creatures, climb in, and call them home.

---

## &nbsp;

![This is biology](/assets/how-crabs-grow.png)

	And when they outgrow one shell, they have to find another. This is not optional. This is not a lifestyle choice. This is biology.

---

## &nbsp;

![Knowing vs doing](/assets/how-crabs-grow.png)

	But knowing something and doing something are two very different things.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold was avoiding it](/assets/how-crabs-grow.png)

	Actually, Harold hadn't really forgotten. He was avoiding it. Because leaving one shell and moving to the next is scary.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold can't sleep](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	That night, Harold couldn't sleep. He watched the moon rise over the ocean and thought about all the shells he'd had before.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold's first shell](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	His first shell had been tiny. A little white spiral, barely bigger than a pebble - just like Edwin's.

---

## &nbsp;

![He'd loved that shell](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	He'd loved that shell. But one day it got tight, and he'd left it behind.

---

## &nbsp;

![All the shells](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	Then there was the speckled one. And the one with the chip in it. And the one that was slightly lopsided but had good ventilation.

---

## &nbsp;

![He'd left them all](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	He'd left them all. And every single time, he'd felt squished first.

---

## &nbsp;

![Every single time terrified](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	And every single time, he'd been terrified.

---

## &nbsp;

![Every single time fine](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	And every single time, he'd been fine.

---

## &nbsp;

![Huh said Harold](/assets/harold-contemplating.png)

	"Huh," said Harold.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold makes a decision](/assets/harold-scuttling.png)

	The next morning, Harold made a decision. He scuttled along the shoreline, looking. Searching.

---

## &nbsp;

![The dream shell](/assets/dream-shell.png)

	He passed a massive shell - gorgeous, speckled, nearly twice his size. For a moment, he imagined himself in it. His dream shell.

---

## &nbsp;

![Too big](/assets/dream-shell.png)

	But it was too big. Too heavy to carry. Too much space to fill. Maybe in a couple of crab-years. Not now.

---

## &nbsp;

![A beat-up shell](/assets/harold-meh-shell.png)

	He passed another that was a little bigger than his current one - but older. A little beat up. A little tired. He filed that away.

---

## &nbsp;

![Another shell](/assets/new-shell-empty.png)

	But then he saw another one. He circled it. Inspected it. Peered inside.

---

## &nbsp;

![Fetching spiral pattern](/assets/new-shell-empty.png)

	It had a rather fetching spiral pattern. Streamlined. Aerodynamic. And it was just sitting there, empty, waiting.

---

## &nbsp;

![Was this his next shell](/assets/new-shell-empty.png)

	Was this his next shell?

---

## &nbsp;

![It looked right](/assets/new-shell-empty.png)

	It looked good. It looked right.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold positions shells](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	Harold positioned his old shell right next to the new one. Close as he could get. One quick move. That's all it would take.

---

## &nbsp;

![Naked soft exposed](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	But that move meant being naked. Soft. Exposed. Even just for a moment.

---

## &nbsp;

![Here we go](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	"Right," said Harold. "Here we go."

---

## &nbsp;

![He stopped](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	Then he stopped. Still inside his old shell.

---

## &nbsp;

![His old shell had things](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	His old shell had things in it. His little pile of sand, arranged just so. His worn-smooth corner where he liked to sleep.

---

## &nbsp;

![Sea glass](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	His piece of gold sea glass - tumbled smooth by the ocean and perfect for leaning against. Crab-years of careful arrangement.

---

## &nbsp;

![Could he leave it](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	He couldn't just leave it all. Could he?

---

## &nbsp;

![Looking between shells](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	Harold looked across at the new shell. Then back at his old stuff.

---

## &nbsp;

![Imagining carrying it all](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	He imagined carrying it all across - every grain, every pebble, every familiar scrap. Piling it into the new shell.

---

## &nbsp;

![Different shape](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	But the new shell was a different shape. The corners were in different places. His old pile of sand wouldn't fit the same way. His worn-smooth corner wouldn't exist.

---

## &nbsp;

![Too heavy](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	And the new shell was bigger. Heavier. He'd have to learn how to carry it. Did he really want to weigh it down with all his old stuff too?

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold makes his move](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	Harold grabbed his sea glass and one clawful of sand - just the good stuff, just the bits he really wanted - and wiggled out of his old shell.

---

## &nbsp;

![Naked soft ridiculous](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	Naked. Soft. Ridiculous.

---

## &nbsp;

![He dashed across](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	He dashed across to the new one. But at the entrance, he stopped.

---

## &nbsp;

![Looking back](/assets/gull-cam.png)

	He looked back at what was left in his old shell. Did he really need it? Did he really want it?

---

## &nbsp;

![A seagull overhead](/assets/seagull.png)

	A seagull squawked overhead. Harold didn't think. He threw himself inside.

---

## &nbsp;

![Heart pounding](/assets/two-shells.png)

	Heart pounding.

---

## &nbsp;

![His old shell on the sand](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	He looked back at his old shell, sitting there on the sand with most of his stuff still in it. Too late now.

---

## &nbsp;

![Strange](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	He looked around. Strange.

---

## &nbsp;

![Unfamiliar curves](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	The walls were in different places. The curves were unfamiliar. He didn't know which way to lean when the waves came.

---

## &nbsp;

![But he could breathe](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	But he could breathe. He could stretch.

---

## &nbsp;

![Sea glass in new corner](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	And the sea glass? It fit nicely in a new corner. A different corner. *His* corner.

---

## &nbsp;

![So much space](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	There was space - so much space - for things he hadn't even thought of yet.

---

## &nbsp;

![Maybe better](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	"Okay," Harold admitted. "Maybe this is actually... better."

---

## &nbsp;

![A few weeks later](/assets/harold-scuttling-new-shell.png)

	A few weeks later, Harold was scuttling along the shoreline when something caught his eye.

---

## &nbsp;

![Sea glass glimmer](/assets/harold-scuttling-new-shell.png)

	A glimmer. Green, tumbled smooth. Sea glass.

---

## &nbsp;

![Coming out of his shell](/assets/harold-scuttling-new-shell.png)

	He went to investigate. He'd been doing more of that lately. Coming out of his shell. Exploring. Looking for new things to put in new corners.

---

## &nbsp;

![Sea grass](/assets/harold-scuttling-new-shell.png)

	He scuttled past a patch of sea grass, swaying in the current. Harold had heard rumours there was another type of grass, up on the land somewhere. He didn't believe it.

---

## &nbsp;

![A queue of hermit crabs](/assets/gull-cam-queue.png)

	And that's when he came across something remarkable. A queue of hermit crabs. Lined up from biggest to smallest. All waiting beside a row of empty shells.

---

## &nbsp;

![The biggest crab](/assets/gull-cam-queue.png)

	The biggest crab climbed into the biggest shell - a gorgeous spotted thing, nearly the size of a coconut.

---

## &nbsp;

![The vacancy chain](/assets/gull-cam-queue.png)

	Then the second-biggest crab climbed into the shell the first one had just left. And the third crab climbed into the shell the second one had left. And so on, all the way down the line.

---

## &nbsp;

![The community moves up](/assets/gull-cam-queue.png)

	One shell became available, and the whole community moved up together. Harold watched, transfixed.

---

## &nbsp;

![Beautiful isn't it](/assets/gull-cam-queue.png)

	"Beautiful, isn't it?" Harold turned. Mabel had settled beside him.

---

## &nbsp;

![I had no idea](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"I had no idea we did that," Harold said.

---

## &nbsp;

![Growth is not a solo project](/assets/mabel.png)

	"Most crabs don't. They think growth is a solo project."

---

## &nbsp;

![When you move shells](/assets/mabel.png)

	"They don't realise - when you move to a bigger shell, you leave your old one behind. And someone smaller moves into it. And someone smaller moves into theirs."

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold's old shell](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	Harold thought about his old brown shell. He'd just... left it there. Empty. He hadn't thought about who might find it.

---

## &nbsp;

![So when I grow](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"So when I grow..." Harold began.

---

## &nbsp;

![You make room](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"You make room for everyone behind you," said Mabel.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin at the end of the line](/assets/the-queue.png)

	Harold scanned the line of crabs. And there - at the very end - was a tiny crab with a familiar face. Edwin.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin climbs into a shell](/assets/edwin-new-shell.png)

	The little crab was climbing into a shell Harold recognised. Small. Speckled. A little worn around the edges.

---

## &nbsp;

![One of Harold's old shells](/assets/edwin-new-shell.png)

	One of his old shells. From crab-years ago. He'd thought he could never leave that one, either.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin pokes his head out](/assets/edwin-new-shell.png)

	Edwin poked his head out and looked around, delighted.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin explores](/assets/edwin-new-shell.png)

	Harold watched him explore the corners. Watched him find a spot he seemed to like.

---

## &nbsp;

![Edwin rearranging](/assets/edwin-new-shell.png)

	Then Edwin started rearranging things. Pushing sand around. Making it his own.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold smiled](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	Harold smiled.

---

## &nbsp;

![Mabel still beside him](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	Mabel was still beside him.

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold confesses](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"You know," Harold said slowly, "I tried to bring all my stuff with me. When I changed shells. I was planning to ferry it all across, one clawful at a time."

---

## &nbsp;

![A seagull](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"What happened?" "A seagull."

---

## &nbsp;

![Mabel laughed](/assets/mabel.png)

	Mabel laughed.

---

## &nbsp;

![What Harold brought](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"I only brought what I could carry in one trip," Harold said. "My sea glass. A bit of sand. The stuff I really wanted."

---

## &nbsp;

![Left it behind](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"And the rest?" "Left it behind."

---

## &nbsp;

![We all make that mistake](/assets/mabel.png)

	Mabel nodded. "We all make that mistake. You think you need to bring everything."

---

## &nbsp;

![That version of you](/assets/mabel.png)

	"But some things only belonged in that shell. That size. That version of you."

---

## &nbsp;

![What do you bring](/assets/mabel.png)

	"What do you bring, then?" Harold asked.

---

## &nbsp;

![Only what you need](/assets/mabel.png)

	"Only what you really need and really want. Leave the rest for whoever comes next."

---

## &nbsp;

![Mabel gestures to Edwin](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	She gestured toward Edwin. "They won't keep it all anyway."

---

## &nbsp;

![They'll redecorate](/assets/mabel-and-harold-new.png)

	"They'll redecorate. Move things around. Make it theirs. Just like you're doing with your new shell."

---

## &nbsp;

![Harold looks down](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	Harold looked down at himself. He'd barely noticed, but he had been redecorating.

---

## &nbsp;

![New spots new corners](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	His sea glass in a new spot. New pile of sand in a different corner. New favourite spot to watch the sunset.

---

## &nbsp;

![It was just his](/assets/harold-new-shell.png)

	The shell wasn't empty anymore. It was just... his.

---

## &nbsp;

![That night](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	That night, Harold sat in his new shell - which didn't feel so new anymore - and thought about everything he'd learned.

---

## &nbsp;

![Growth is uncomfortable](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	Growth is uncomfortable. It starts with feeling squished.

---

## &nbsp;

![The naked moment](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	And then comes that terrible, necessary, naked moment - when you're not who you were, and not yet who you're becoming.

---

## &nbsp;

![You cannot skip it](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	You cannot skip it. You cannot stuff your new shell with your old life. You have to leave some things behind - for whoever comes next.

---

## &nbsp;

![You've done this before](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	But here's the part they don't tell you: You've done this before.

---

## &nbsp;

![Every shell](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	Every shell you've ever had, you once thought you couldn't leave. And every shell you've ever left, you can barely remember now.

---

## &nbsp;

![Comfort zone](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	Some crabs never leave. They call it their comfort zone. But there's nothing comfortable about a shell that no longer fits. It's just familiar.

---

## &nbsp;

![The moon rose](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	Harold sat with that thought for a while. The moon rose over the ocean. The waves came in.

---

## &nbsp;

![Watching the stars](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	Harold leaned into the curve of his shell - a new curve, one he was still learning - and watched the stars.

---

## &nbsp;

![Still growing](/assets/harold-contemplating-new.png)

	He wasn't squished anymore. But he knew he would be again. And that would mean he was still growing.
